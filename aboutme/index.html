    <p>
      My name is Reece. I live in sunny South Africa. I have been a member of
      the church my entire life. Some of my hobbies include playing football
      (soccer), reading and playing video games.

      I currently work at a asset management company doing data related work
      such as reporting and integration. I am working towards a degree in
      software development in order to further my understanding of coding and
      advance my career.
