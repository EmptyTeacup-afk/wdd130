        OUR BEGINNING
        Founded by Celso de Nobrega in 2023, Football CPT originated as a simple idea of filming amateur football matches. The purpose behind this was to capture the essence of friendly football matches, while creating lasting memories for the participants. Over time this vision has evolved, and we are now committed to elevating the local amateur football scene in Cape Town.
        OUR MISSION
        At Football CPT, our mission is to foster the growth and development of amateur football by providing a dynamic platform for local players and teams with a greater ‘reason’ to play. 
        Our goal is to create a vibrant community that celebrates the passion for football and connects like-minded individuals who share a common love for the beautiful game. 
        OUR INITIATIVES
        SOCIAL MEDIA
        From the start, Football CPT has focused on leveraging the power of social media to grow our community and showcase local talent. 
        EVENTS
        We take pride in organizing and hosting local events for various teams and players to participate in. These events allow for players, from all walks of life, to participate as well as to form networks within the community. 
        At Football CPT we are committed to providing a platform for football enthusiasts to connect with like-minded people, showcase their abilities and create memories both on and off the pitch.
