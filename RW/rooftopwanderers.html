            Founded in 2023, Rooftop Wanderers is Football CPT’s official competitive team. Currently playing in the Grand Central league in the heart of the mother city. Nothing beats playing football on a rooftop with Table Mountain in the backdrop! The team was founded to allow local players to showcase their talents on a more competitive stage. Since its founding Rooftop Wanderers has won four league titles in a row and is pushing for its seventh (as of 2025). The team has seen its players come and go with many of them being from the local area. All of them with different background and personalities, truly embracing South Africa’s diversity.
